# 🌐 Website UI Components

Welcome to **Website UI Components**, a growing collection of modern, animated, and reusable UI components you can drop into your web projects! 🚀

This repository includes elements like buttons, cards, navbars, forms, websites and full sections — each built with clean HTML and CSS (and later, maybe JavaScript or React).

I’m adding **one new component every day** to stay consistent and help others easily find ready-to-use website building blocks.
